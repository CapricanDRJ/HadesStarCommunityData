# Hades Star Community Data

## Overview
This repository serves as an accessible mirror for the Hades Star game's global whitestar match reports, originally hosted with Google API. I've converted the data into both JSON and CSV formats to make it easier for the community to access and utilize. This data is foundational for various community projects, including bots like the one I've developed for ELO rankings.

## Accessing the Data
The original database, challenging for many to access due to its format and hosting, has been converted and is available here in two formats:

- **JSON**: For those who prefer working with object notation for web and application development.
- **CSV**: Ideal for those who work with spreadsheets or traditional data analysis tools.

## Original Database Source
The data provided here is a direct conversion of the original database found at:
- [Hades Star Public Database](https://storage.googleapis.com/hades-star-public-xq8f-d4rg-v0d9)

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to facilitate community access to Hades Star's public API, enabling developers, data analysts, and enthusiasts to engage with the data more effectively for their projects.

## Hades' Star ELO Rankings Bot

The data in this repository powers the Hades' Star ELO Rankings Bot, a sophisticated tool designed for tracking and calculating ELO rankings in Hades Star Whitestar matches. For integration with your Discord server or for more details:
